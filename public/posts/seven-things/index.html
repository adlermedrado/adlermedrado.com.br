not deny my participation. :-) I think it is a opportunity to tell you some things that probably you may not know about
me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote my first software using turbo pascal. Was a kind of calendar software for my BBS.</li>
<li>I already have practice in Karate, Kung-fu and Kickboxing. I have fought in some kung-fu championships and gained some
medals.</li>
<li>Jewish is my religion.</li>
<li>I like to study history and military issues as a hobby.</li>
<li>I like to cook. Tabule and macarroni(pasta) are my specialities.</li>
<li>In 1994 I was interviewed and I had my photo in the first page of the Correio Braziliense (a local newspaper). It was
a reportage about BBS.</li>
<li>I have already lived in several Brazilian cities in the states of PR, DF, PE, SP and RJ. Some people call me a
gypsy. :)</li>
