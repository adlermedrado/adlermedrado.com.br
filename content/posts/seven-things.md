This is the first time I take part a meme/tag, as it was my friend [Rafael Dohms](https://doh.ms) who invited me, I will
not deny my participation. :-) I think it is a opportunity to tell you some things that probably you may not know about
me.

- I wrote my first software using turbo pascal. Was a kind of calendar software for my BBS.
- I already have practice in Karate, Kung-fu and Kickboxing. I have fought in some kung-fu championships and gained some
  medals.
- Jewish is my religion.
- I like to study history and military issues as a hobby.
- I like to cook. Tabule and macarroni(pasta) are my specialities.
- In 1994 I was interviewed and I had my photo in the first page of the Correio Braziliense (a local newspaper). It was
  a reportage about BBS.
- I have already lived in several Brazilian cities in the states of PR, DF, PE, SP and RJ. Some people call me a
  gypsy. :)

Now i will tag another brazilian guys.

Elton Minetto - Good Guy! Author of a good book about frameworks.
Eustáquio Rangel - Very smart. Owner of the PHPReports project. Ah, he is good in ruby too and wrote a good book.
Marcelio Leal - Cool guy from Amazônia. Leader of “PHP Pai D’égua” User Group.
Newton Wagner - A PHPDF Member. Good person.

Bruno Pereira (Porkaria) - Leader of PHPMS User Group. Good guy and very active in our community too.
