I'm using macOS again, and of course that I'll forget this tip, so I'll write this post to help me another day in the
future.

If you want to enable the click and drag option on MacBook, just go to: **System Preferences → Accessibility → Pointer
Control → Mouse and Trackpad → Trackpad Options → Enable Dragging.**
