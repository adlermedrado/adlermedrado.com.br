Yesterday, [I published a blog](https://adlermedrado.com.br/posts/shadowdata-sensitive-data-handler/) post introducing my new open-source project, ShadowData.

This post is just to inform anyone interested that I have made some updates today.

New Features Added to the Project:

* Email address anonymization
* Phone number anonymization
* Symmetric cryptography for encryption and decryption
* Minor improvements to tests and code quality

You can look the code at the [Github repository](https://github.com/adlermedrado/ShadowData/).

See you.
