## Life
I need to improve quality of life, so I'm trying to:

* Losing weight
* Going on a diet
* Lifting weight

# Work
* Remote work, work anywhere
* Learning about A.I
* I've started producing videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@adlermedrado) again (Only in Portuguese, for now)
* Started a new opensource project called ShadowData, that is a Python library designed to simplify the processing and handling of sensitive data securely and efficiently.
* Working on two side jobs, let's see what will happen.
