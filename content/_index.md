# Tech Enthusiast and Problem Solver

Welcome to my website!

I’m Adler Medrado, an IT professional with over 20 years of experience. 

My journey began in my teens, building a BBS on an old PC/AT 386. I've worked with various systems, from MS-DOS to Linux.

I thrive in startup environments and enjoy collaborating with talented people. My expertise spans multiple industries, including finance, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in History. If you’d like to connect, check out my blog or contact me via email for a secure conversation.
