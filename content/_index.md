# Hi, my name is **Adler Medrado** and this is [my little](https://movie-sounds.org/action-movie-sound-clips/quotes-with-sound-clips-from-the-warriors-1979/our-turf-our-little-piece-of-turf) [piece of turf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcc2ltIjNU0).

## About me

I have 20+ years of experience in IT. Working with computers since my teenage, when I built my own BBS
using an PC/AT 386 running MS-DOS and Remote Access, moving after to the IBM OS/2 Warp and Windows 95 and started to
learn linux at late 90s and early 00s.

My motto is: If I don't know it, I can learn it. I'm a self-taught, I like to study and develop my own
solutions.

I'm a problem solver who likes the challenging atmosphere of the startups, also like to work with smart people.

I have experience across the financial, internet, e-commerce, government, healthcare and crypto industries working
as developer, techlead, architect and more.

Currently I'm graduating in History at Universidade Cruzeiro do Sul.

Programming is not only a skill but my passion.

## Contact

I have accounts in some instant messaging services and we can't trust if they protect our privacy, so if you want to
talk to me privately, I think that an PGP encrypted email is the safest way.
